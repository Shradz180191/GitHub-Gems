What did you learn too late in life?

- That body language speaks a lot more than actual words. It matters. A lot.
- You can always earn money. It's not a big deal. Your world is not going to end because you don't have a fixed income. Something else will work out.
- Saying No is important. People don't get offended as much as you think.
- You use only less than 10% of stuff you possess. Get rid of that stuff that you hardly ever use, you will have that many less things to worry about.
- What people say when they are angry, aren’t things they mean. They regret it often. Forgive angry people. It’s okay, they are only human.
- There are no winners in an argument. Only losers. Don’t ruin your relationships arguing about things that don’t really matter.
- Nothing is complicated. Not as much as you assume. It's just your mind playing tricks with you. If you get down to it, it’s all really simple and clear.
- Loving your partner is a choice, not a feeling. And your character is the choices you make.
- No one in this world will stand up for you like the way your parents do. Always be there for them.
